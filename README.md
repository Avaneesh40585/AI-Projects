# AI-Projects
I put together this set of AI projects as a way to dive deeper into real-world applications of artificial intelligence. Each project tackles a practical use case — whether it’s natural language processing, computer vision, or decision-making systems — with the goal of learning by doing. If you’re exploring AI and prefer building things over just reading about them, there’s a good chance you’ll find something useful (or at least interesting) here. Contributions and ideas are always welcome!
