# AI-Projects
I put together this set of AI projects as a way to dive deeper into real-world applications of artificial intelligence. Each project tackles a practical use case — whether it’s natural language processing, computer vision, or decision-making systems — with the goal of learning by doing. If you’re exploring AI and prefer building things over just reading about them, there’s a good chance you’ll find something useful (or at least interesting) here. Contributions and ideas are always welcome!

## Domains Covered

| Domain                        | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Machine Learning**          | Algorithms and statistical models—including deep learning neural networks—that enable systems to automatically learn patterns, extract complex features, and make predictions or decisions from data, often improving performance with experience and minimal explicit programming. |
| **Computer Vision**           | Techniques and models that allow computers to interpret, analyze, and understand visual information from images and videos, enabling tasks like object detection, image classification, and scene understanding. |
| **Natural Language Processing** | Methods and algorithms for enabling computers to understand, interpret, generate, and interact using human language in both text and speech forms, supporting applications such as translation, summarization, and conversational AI. |
| **Reinforcement Learning**    | A learning paradigm where agents autonomously learn optimal actions through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, guided by feedback in the form of rewards or penalties to maximize cumulative success. |
