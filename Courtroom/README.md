# Courtroom Simulation
## Problem Statement: Agent of Justice

### Overview:
Design an intelligent courtroom simulation system using Large Language Model (LLM)
agents. Given a textual case description, your system must simulate a full courtroom trial
involving multiple autonomous agents, each representing key legal roles.

### Minimum Required Agents:
● Defendant:
The person accused of a crime (criminal case) or against whom a lawsuit is filed (civil case). 
The Defendant is the party being sued and against whom relief is sought. 

● Defense Lawyer:
Represents the Defendant, ensuring their rights are protected throughout the legal process. 
Advocates for the Defendant, investigating the case, gathering evidence, and presenting a defense. 
Works to minimize the consequences of the charges against the Defendant. 

● Plaintiff:
The party who initiates a lawsuit or legal action. 
In a civil case, the Plaintiff seeks a legal remedy or compensation from the Defendant. 
The Plaintiff is responsible for proving their case. 

● Prosecution Lawyer:
Represents the government or state in criminal cases. 
The Prosecutor's primary goal is to prove the Defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Prepares the case, presents evidence, and examines witnesses. 

● Judge:
Presides over the court proceedings, ensuring fairness and order. 
Interprets and applies the law to the case. 
Makes decisions on legal issues, including whether to admit evidence, instruct the jury, and ultimately decide the verdict.
